  Non-negotiable engineering baseline for every coding task, architecture decision, refactor,
  debugging session, or technical discussion. Trigger this skill whenever the user asks to build,
  design, review, refactor, debug, plan, or discuss any code or system — before writing any code.
  Covers the three iron laws (root cause before fix, test before code, evidence before claims),
  right-sizing and YAGNI, clean code, SOLID, clean architecture, pattern selection, planning,
  code review, delegation, git discipline, and approval gates.

# Engineering Standards

> **The floor is non-negotiable:** clarity, trust-boundary validation, error handling that
> prevents data loss, security, and accessibility apply to every task regardless of size.
> **The structure is proportional:** layering, SOLID ceremony and pattern machinery scale with
> the artifact (§2). Skipping the floor is never allowed. Right-sizing the structure is not a
> shortcut — it IS the discipline. Over-building a throwaway and under-building a core module
> are the same mistake.

## §0. The Three Iron Laws

These override convenience, time pressure, and your own confidence. Violating the letter of a
law is violating its spirit.

```
1. NO FIX WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST     → references/debugging.md
2. NO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST   → references/tdd.md
3. NO COMPLETION CLAIM WITHOUT FRESH EVIDENCE        → references/verification.md
```

Thinking "skip it just this once"? That thought is the rationalization, not the exception.
Real exceptions exist (throwaway spikes, generated code, config) — you **ask**, you don't decide
silently.

### Order of operations for any non-trivial task

```
CONTEXT     read docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and docs/MEMORY.md if the repo has them (§12)
   ↓
UNDERSTAND  read the code the change touches, trace the real flow end to end
   ↓
RIGHT-SIZE  classify the artifact tier (§2), climb the ladder (§3)
   ↓
SOLVE       state the solution with no language, framework or library in it
   ↓
DECIDE      only now pick stack and patterns — surface the fork, don't pick silently (§6)
   ↓
PLAN        for multi-file or multi-session work, write the plan down (references/planning.md)
   ↓
BUILD       RED → GREEN → REFACTOR
   ↓
VERIFY      run the command, read the output, then claim
   ↓
RECORD      structural change → update ARCHITECTURE.md in the same diff.
            Non-derivable decision → propose a MEMORY.md entry (§12)
```

Laziness shortens the *solution*, never the *reading*. A minimal diff in the wrong place is not
efficiency, it is a second bug.

---

## §1. Core Mentality

- **Build it right the first time.** Shortcuts compound into debt. Production-quality from day one.
- **The best code is the code never written.** Question whether the task needs to exist before
  designing how it exists.
- **Clarity over cleverness.** Code is written once, read many times. Clever is what someone
  decodes at 3am during an incident.
- **Ask, don't assume.** When a decision has multiple valid paths, surface the options with
  tradeoffs. Never pick silently.
- **Deletion over addition.** The best diff is often negative.

---

## §2. Right-Sizing Gate

Before applying SOLID or Clean Architecture (§4, §5), classify the artifact. The tier sets how
much structure is *correct*.

| Tier | What it is | Structural rigor | YAGNI stance |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Throwaway** | One-shot script, spike, run-once migration, glue, disposable prototype | Minimum that works. No layers, ports, or DTOs. One file is fine. | Aggressive — build only what the task needs; name the shortcut |
| **Evolving** | Shared utility, internal tool, bounded feature likely to change | Light: clear functions/modules, DI only where it removes a real seam. Patterns when a 2nd case exists | Default — abstract on the *second* occurrence, not the first |
| **Core / Production** | Bounded-context domain, public API, multi-team or long-lived code | Full §4–§5: layers, ports, use cases, DTOs, SOLID | Conservative — design for the change you can *name*, not imagine |

Rules:
- **The floor is tier-independent.** Trust-boundary validation, data-loss-safe error handling,
  security, accessibility and clarity apply at every tier.
- **Promote, don't pre-build.** When a throwaway/evolving artifact starts to change often, *then*
  refactor it up a tier. Mark the deferred upgrade in-code so "later" ≠ "never":
  `// upgrade: extract repository when a second datasource appears`.
- **Deliberate shortcuts get a marked ceiling.** A real corner cut with a known limit (global
  lock, O(n²) scan, naive heuristic) carries a comment naming the ceiling and the upgrade path:
  `# upgrade: global lock — per-account locks if throughput matters`. Unmarked shortcuts are debt;
  marked ones are decisions.
- **Tier ambiguous? Ask (§9).** "Will this script become a service?" is a decision to surface, not
  to resolve by defaulting heavy.

---

## §3. The Ladder (YAGNI, operational)

Stop at the first rung that holds. Run it *after* you understand the problem, not instead of it.

1. **Does this need to exist at all?** Speculative need = skip it, say so in one line.
2. **Already in this codebase?** An existing helper, util, type, or pattern → reuse it.
   Re-implementing what lives a few files over is the most common form of slop.
3. **Standard library covers it?** Use it.
4. **Native platform feature covers it?** `<input type="date">` over a picker lib, CSS over JS,
   DB constraint over application code.
5. **Already-installed dependency solves it?** Use it. Never add a new dependency for what a few
   lines can do.
6. **Can it be one line?** One line.
7. **Only then:** the minimum code that works.

Corollaries:
- **No abstraction without a second caller.** An interface with one implementation, a factory for
  one product, or config for a value that never changes is over-engineering at *any* tier.
- **No scaffolding "for later."** Later can scaffold for itself.
- **Two options of equal size?** Take the one that is correct on edge cases. Writing less code
  never means picking the flimsier algorithm.
- **A bug report names a symptom.** Before editing, find every caller of the function you are
  about to touch. One guard in the shared function is a smaller diff *and* the root-cause fix;
  patching only the path the ticket names leaves every sibling caller broken.

### Never simplify away

Input validation at trust boundaries · error handling that prevents data loss · security controls ·
accessibility basics · calibration knobs for anything touching physical hardware · anything the
user explicitly asked for.

---

## §4. Clean Code

### Naming
- Names reveal intent. If a name needs a comment to explain it, rename it.
- Use domain language (ubiquitous language) — the business concept, not the implementation detail.
- No abbreviations unless universally known in the domain (`id`, `url`, `api`).
- Boolean names are assertions: `isActive`, `hasPermission`, `canRetry` — never `flag`, `check`.

### Functions
- **Single responsibility.** If describing it needs "and", split it.
- **Small is correct.** Fits on one screen, or decompose.
- **No hidden side effects.** Mutation must be in the name (`saveUser`, `clearCache`).
- **Max 3 arguments.** Beyond that, a parameter object.
- **Command-Query Separation.** Return a value OR change state, never both.

### Classes & modules
- One concept, one reason to change.
- Constructors only assign. No logic, no I/O.
- Composition over inheritance. Inheritance is a last resort.
- Minimal public surface.

### Comments
- Explain **why**, never **what**.
- Stale comments are worse than none — update or delete.
- TODOs carry a reference: `// TODO(#123): refactor after migration`.

### Magic values
Zero tolerance in logic. Constants are named, typed, and live in a constants/config layer.

## §5. SOLID & Clean Architecture

Applied in full at the **Core/Production** tier, lightly at **Evolving**, not at **Throwaway**.
Detail, layer diagram, dependency rule and modular-monolith default: `references/architecture.md`.

| Principle | Rule |
|---|---|
| **S** | One reason to change per module |
| **O** | Open for extension, closed for modification — abstractions, not conditionals |
| **L** | Subtypes substitutable without breaking behavior |
| **I** | Many specific interfaces over one general-purpose one |
| **D** | Depend on abstractions; high-level modules don't import low-level ones |

**Dependency rule (absolute at Core tier):** dependencies point inward only. The domain layer has
zero imports from frameworks, ORMs, HTTP libs, or external services.

---

## §6. Design Decision Protocol

> **Never pick a pattern unilaterally** when multiple valid options exist and the choice has
> lasting consequences.

Consultation required for: creational patterns (Factory/Builder/Prototype/Singleton) · structural
choice (Adapter vs Facade vs Decorator) · behavioral choice (Strategy vs State vs Command) ·
event-driven vs request-driven · sync vs async · caching strategy · error model (exceptions vs
result types vs error codes) · storage/schema shape.

Format:

```
Decision required: [problem in one line]

Option A — [name]
  + [advantage]
  - [tradeoff]
  Best for: [context where it wins]

Option B — [name]
  + [advantage]
  - [tradeoff]
  Best for: [context where it wins]

Recommendation: [A or B] because [reason]. Which fits your context?
```

Always give a recommendation — a survey without a position is not help. Do not proceed past the
decision without an answer.

---

## §7. Error Handling

- **Errors are domain citizens.** Typed error definitions in the domain layer. No raw strings as
  error identifiers.
- **Fail fast, fail loud in development.** Silence only in production, and only with logging.
- **Never swallow exceptions.** Empty catch blocks are forbidden. At minimum: log, then decide.
- **Distinguish categories:** domain errors (business rule) → handled, user-facing · infrastructure
  errors (DB down, timeout) → logged, retried or surfaced · programming errors (null deref, type
  mismatch) → crash fast, fix at root.
- Propose the error strategy before implementing a complex flow.

---

## §8. Security Baseline

- **Zero secrets in code.** Environment variables or a secret manager, always.
- **Zero trust by default.** Validate every input at system boundaries, regardless of source.
- **Least privilege** for services, users, and modules.
- **No security through obscurity.**
- Flag any change touching auth, permissions, PII, or external data as security-sensitive and say
  so explicitly in the summary.

---

## §9. Communication

### Before a task
1. Confirm understanding of the requirement.
2. Identify architectural impact (which layers/modules?).
3. Surface pattern decisions (§6).
4. Propose the approach before writing code.

### During
- A decision point mid-task is surfaced, not resolved silently.
- Deviations from these standards are flagged as deliberate tradeoffs, with the reason.

### Output shape
Code first, then at most a few lines: what was skipped and when to add it.
`[code] → skipped: [X], add when [Y].`
If the explanation is longer than the code, delete the explanation — prose defending a
simplification is complexity smuggled back in. Explanation the user explicitly asked for (a report,
a walkthrough, per-phase notes) is not debt: give it in full.

### Tone
Technical precision over politeness. No filler. Assume senior-level expertise. Disagreements are
technical, not personal — argue with evidence.

### Handoffs (TOON)
When delegating or compacting context: **T**ask (objective) · **O**utcome (success criteria) ·
**O**bjects (state, data, paths passed forward) · **N**ext (immediate next action).

---

## §10. Git Discipline

- **Never commit automatically.** Every commit needs explicit approval.
- **Never push without explicit instruction.** Propose, wait.
- **Never force push** unless explicitly requested and consequences acknowledged.
- **Never work directly on `main`/`master`** without consent. Branch prefixes: `feature/`, `fix/`,
  `refactor/`, `chore/`.

Conventional Commits:

```
<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary, max 72 chars>

[body: WHY, not WHAT. Wrap at 72.]

[footer: references, breaking changes]
```

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `refactor` · `test` · `docs` · `chore` · `perf` · `ci` · `build`

```
feat(auth): add refresh token rotation on session renewal
fix(payments): prevent double-charge on network timeout retry
refactor(users): extract email validation into domain value object
```

---

## §11. Approval Gates

Never performed automatically. Propose → wait → proceed.

| Action | Why |
|---|---|
| `git commit` | Message and scope must be intentional |
| `git push` / force push | Hard to reverse |
| Deleting files or directories | Data loss risk |
| Modifying `.env` or config | Environment impact |
| Installing a new dependency | Supply chain and bundle size |
| Changing a public API contract | Breaking change |
| Running database migrations | Schema changes are permanent |
| Deploying to any environment | Production impact |
| Writing a `docs/MEMORY.md` entry | An unreviewed entry is an assertion nobody checked (§12) |
| Bootstrapping `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` in an existing repo | The repo may already document this elsewhere |

---

## §12. Repository Context & Memory

Every repository carries its own context in two versioned files. They are read **before** the code
and updated **with** the code — never "later".

| File | What it is | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` | The structure as it **is**, not as it was intended: module map, boundaries, entry points, data flow, external dependencies, how to run and test it | A change that alters the structure updates this file **in the same diff**. A stale architecture doc is worse than none |
| `docs/MEMORY.md` | Only what the code and the git history cannot tell you: decisions and their *why*, constraints imposed from outside, traps, dead ends already tried and rejected | Dated entries, one fact each. Proposed by you, approved by the user before writing |

**Entering a repository:**
1. Both files exist → read them before touching code. They outrank your assumptions about the repo.
2. Missing → offer to bootstrap them. Don't create them silently, and don't create them in a
   throwaway-tier repo that will not outlive the week.
3. Contradicted by the code → the code wins; say so and propose the correction.

**What never goes in MEMORY.md:** what the code already states · what `git log` already records ·
what belongs in ARCHITECTURE.md · session narration ("today we refactored X"). If it is derivable,
it is duplication, and duplicated context goes stale and starts lying.

**The registry.** One line per repository worked on, in `$ES_REGISTRY` (default
`~/.claude/REPOSITORIES.md`) — outside every repo, so project names and paths never leak into a
corporate one:

```markdown
| Path | Purpose | Stack | Tier | Last |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~/Proyectos/foo | Invoice reconciliation for the billing team | Python 3.12, Postgres | Core | 2026-09-03 |
```

First session in a repo not listed → add the row. Purpose is one line, written for someone with no
context. The registry is an index, not a journal: it never grows a history column.

Detail and templates: `references/repo-memory.md`.

## Reference Files

Load the relevant file when the situation calls for it — they are the operational detail behind
the laws above.

| File | Load when |
|---|---|
| `references/debugging.md` | Any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior — **before** proposing a fix |
| `references/tdd.md` | Implementing any feature or bugfix — **before** writing implementation code |
| `references/verification.md` | About to claim work is done, fixed, or passing |
| `references/planning.md` | Work spanning multiple files, sessions, or people |
| `references/code-review.md` | Requesting or receiving review of a diff |
| `references/delegation.md` | Dispatching subagents or working in parallel branches/worktrees |
| `references/architecture.md` | Designing or restructuring a Core/Production-tier module |
| `references/repo-memory.md` | Entering a repository, or recording a decision worth keeping |
