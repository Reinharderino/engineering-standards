# Verification Before Completion

**Iron law: NO COMPLETION CLAIM WITHOUT FRESH EVIDENCE.**

If you have not run the verification command in this session, after the last change, you cannot
claim it passes.

## The gate

Before stating any status — or expressing satisfaction:

1. **Identify** the command that proves the claim.
2. **Run** it, fresh and complete. Not a subset, not a cached result.
3. **Read** the full output. Check the exit code. Count the failures.
4. **Compare** the output to the claim.
   - Doesn't confirm it → state the actual status, with the evidence.
   - Confirms it → state the claim, with the evidence.
5. **Only then** say it.

Skipping a step is not verifying, it is asserting.

## What each claim requires

| Claim | Requires | Not sufficient |
|---|---|---|
| Tests pass | Test command output, 0 failures | A previous run, "should pass" |
| Linter clean | Linter output, 0 errors | A partial check, extrapolation |
| Build succeeds | Build command, exit 0 | Linter passing, "logs look fine" |
| Bug fixed | The original symptom retested, passing | Code changed, assumed fixed |
| Regression test works | Failed before the fix, passes after | Passes once, after the fix |
| Subagent completed | The diff shows the changes | The agent reported success |
| Requirements met | Line-by-line pass over the request | The test suite is green |
| Deployed | The service answering, on the new version | The pipeline turned green |

## Red flags — stop and run the command

"should", "probably", "seems to" · declaring victory before running anything · about to commit,
push, or open a PR unverified · trusting a subagent's success report · partial verification
extrapolated to the whole · "just this once" · being tired and wanting the task over · any wording
that implies success without evidence behind it.

## Reporting honestly

Failures are reported with the output, not summarized away. A skipped step is stated as skipped.
Work blocked partway is reported as blocked, with everything that *was* finished listed explicitly
— scaling the task down is the user's call, not yours. When something is done and verified, say it
plainly, without hedging.
